A Data project around restaurant orders. Tools I used:
·     Python
·     Pandas
·     Matplotlib 
What I discovered:
·     The fastest restaurants
·     Which payment modes people love the most.
·     Ratings that tell you more than reviews ever could.
·     And those super loyal customers who just don’t stop ordering.
